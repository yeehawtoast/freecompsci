        <p class="sm:text-lg">
          Computer Science and software engineering, while deeply interconnected, are actually two
          separate areas of learning. there is a difference between an electrician and an electrical
          engineer: While both need a proper knowledge of how electricity functions, one knows the
          the practical, hands-on experience of circut building hands-on work and labor involved,
          the other is high-level, being able to see the theory from the practice and designing the
          underpinning systems that drive the hands-on work. Both are useful, both are good.

        <p class="sm:text-lg">
          This site will function similarly <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, but
          rather than focusing on software engineering, we'll dive into the theory, math, and
          concepts that allow us to look deeper under the hood. Using blue collar trades again: If a
          mechanic knows how to build an engine, Computer Scienctists and Engineers know how to
          design one, and understand the physics of how to make them better. This isn't to say a
          mechanic can't know, it's just that their domains are different!

          Right now, this site is work in progress, with new features being added all the time.
          Please check back as we update the site with more content, courses, pathes, and features
          that can make your learning experience better!
