<h1>A Decent Start</h1>

<p>Despite being limited by the whole backend, this is a fairly good start to the Free Computer Science Project. This
    blog will be the Development and Updates blog, so any changes made to the code will documented and pushed out as
    part of the update. Likewise, I'll be pushing out any planning or roadmapping updates here as well, along with
    documentation updates, like the contribution guidlines. </p>
<p>For now, this website is fairly barebones with exactly *checks notes* zero content and some pretty shoddy web design.
    That is what I get for being a systems developer and business/data layer developer. Please be patient as I figure
    out which way is up in TS/JS. In the meantime, here is what we are working on right now to get the site stood up:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Setting up course landing page and course routing</li>
    <li>Creating a system to track progress</li>
    <li>Completing site colors, look and feel</li>
    <li>Polishing site design and styling</li>
    <li>Developing initial course(s)</li>
    <li>Setting up guides for structure, design and standards for lesson, course and path design</li>
</ol>

<p>After getting the site functioning we do have some other tasks we will need to start, such as adding more courses for
    the initial pathway, planning an architecture and tech stack, then migrating the site over to the new stack to allow
    users to generate and create accounts.</p>

<p>I got my work cut out for me, but I'm pretty excited about this</p>
