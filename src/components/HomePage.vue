            This site will function similarly <a href="theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, but
            rather than focusing on software engineering, we'll dive into the theory, math, and
            concepts that allow us to look deeper under the hood. Using blue collar trades again: If
            a mechanic knows how to build an engine, Computer Scienctists and Engineers know how to
            design one, and understand the physics of how to make them better. This isn't to say a
            mechanic can't know, it's just that their domains are different!

            Right now, this site is work in progress, with new features being added all the time.
            Please check back as we update the site with more content, courses, pathes, and features
            that can make your learning experience better!
