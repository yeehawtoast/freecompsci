            The curriculum consists of the lessons and projects on this site. We are constantly
            expanding and updating the curriculum to keep it current and ensure it meets our
            students' needs in learning and developing skills in computer science. Our goal is to
            create the best free computer science curriculum in the world, thus anyone is welcome to
            join in and help us in striving for this goal.

            The site you are on right now is a Vue.js Github Pages application. We are always
            working on new features that improve the platform and help students in their learning
            journey. We are also know that Gh-pages can only sustain us for so long. As a result,
            there is plent of work and issues to deal with as we hope to one day migrate to a more
            complete web application hosting platform. Anyone is welcome to join in and start
            working on any of the issues we currently have posted in the Github repository for the
            site.
