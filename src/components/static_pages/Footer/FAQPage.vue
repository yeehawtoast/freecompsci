            <b>Q: Aren't there a lot of free sites like this out there?</b> A: Yes! In fact, we reccomend looking at a few before starting here:
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    The Odin Project
                </li>
                <li>
                    Freecodecamp
                </li>
                <li>
                    Launch School
                </li>
                <li>
                    Codecademy
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>What makes us different is that we don't teach you from ground up how to code, 
                but rather focus on much of the same material that is taught at universities,
                 allowing you to round out your education as a future or current developer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Q: Is there only one course so far? How many will you have</b> A: This is a fairly new site, so we are starting off on some fairly 
            introductory stuff. However, we do want to offer paths and courses on everything you would encounter as freshmen, all the way up until you become a senior.
        </li>
        <li><b>Q: Is there a way for me to support your work?</b> A: While we currently don't have any official donation method set up, please feel 
            free to reach out at freecomputersci@gmail.com to see how you can financially support the program. There are several things we'd love 
            to offer that we can't yet, simply due to size and budget constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Q: Can I help? I'm a professor/teacher/developer/etc.</b> A: Yes! Anyone can help with this project. Go to github.com/free-comp-sci and see where you want to start helping.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Q: Can I use this material in my classroom?</b> A: This site is built for YOU! The two introductory courses are aligned with Advanced Placement Exams. They are not approved 
            or offical curriculum, so use the resources here as supplamental, rather than a replacement to any existing curriculum program.
