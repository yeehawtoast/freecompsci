      <h1 class="text-4xl pb-10">About Free Computer Science</h1>
      <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
        Free Computer Science started as an unmaintained repo with a simple idea: What if the
        lessons, resources, and content needed to learn computer science as an field were free,
        open-source and available? While now defunct, the Open Source Lesson Plans repo was a way
        for Chris to put his lesson plans from his teaching experience in one place so that everyone
        could have them.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
        Today, Free Computer Science is the start and realization of this dream: To provide quality,
        well-organized courses on the same material that many, if not most, universities teach at
        the undergraduate level. Your "University away from University" so-to-speak.
      </p>
      <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
        This entire project is inspired by the amazing Odin Project as well as freecodecamp among
        others and seeks to be their "content cousin" by creating a place where people of all
        stripes can come and learn or relearn the information that is taught at universities.

        <h1 class="text-4xl pb-10">What You Will Be Able to Expect</h1>
        <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
          This site is built similarly to The Odin Project, both out of the endearing love for its
          style and also out of an acknowledgement that I would not be where I am today without the
          countless efforts of volunteers working to maintain it. This site is very much a work in
          progress, but here is what you will (hopefully) be able to expect over time:
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-10">A Complete, Univeristy-style Education, For Free</h2>
        <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
          While this is not an accedited univeristy, you will be able to "register" for classes,
          listen to lectures, take quizzes and exams to sharpen your knowledge and learn everything
          from Introductory Systems, to Compiler Building and Computer Architecture.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-10">Did I Mention it Was Free?</h2>
        <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
          Open-Source and under the MIT License, You can learn anything, at any time. You can even
          contribute, supportting the cause of open education for everyone.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-10">Recieve Support</h2>
        <p class="sm:text-lg pb-10">
          While it is still just a dream and a half away, like in off-line settings, you will be
          able to learn from knowledgeable people, willing to share information about their favorite
          subjects.
